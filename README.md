Joomla extensions, designed to handle the scheduling and planning needs of the universities sector.

In all software there are mistakes that need to be fixed. The source
code of iCampus projects is centrally located on the internet, making it
accessible to everyone. Besides that there is a possibility to report
bugs. Reported bugs will be solved and eventually need testing. This
page explains how you can contribute to the iCampus projects by testing
proposed solutions or sending change requests. You do not need to have
any coding knowledge, you do need a Joomla installation to test on.
